Random project I wanted to try implementing a toy serial communication protocol

Requires two arduino Unos, one master and one slave
Master has buttons wired to pins 9-12 
Slave has LEDs wired with resistors to pins 9-12,
The two Arduinos have pins 4 and 5 tied to each other 
(pin 4 on master tied to pin 4 on slave, etc.)
